# 📦 SDF-BoiteEnCarton

Welcome in the **BoiteEnCarton**! We are a collective of French modders and tabletop enthusiasts dedicated to bringing the charm of physical board games into the world of **Hytale**.

Our mission is simple: take the games we love from our coffee tables and rebuild them for the Hytale community.

### 🕹️ Our Games

| **Boop** | A deceptively cute and "thinky" strategy game about cats bouncing off a bed. | [View Project](https://github.com/SDF-BoiteEnCarton/Boop) |
